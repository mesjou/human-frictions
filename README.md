## Development

### First usage

To start, you'll need `docker` installed. When done, run this line in human-friction dir:

```bash
docker build -t human-friction:1.0 .
```

It will build docker image, used for running other commands.
You can execute scripts using Docker. Docker must be build to reflect changes.

```bash
docker run human-friction:1.0
```

### Daily development

To start development, edit files in your editor. 
You can execute scripts using Docker. 
Docker must be build to reflect changes.

```bash
docker run human-friction:1.0
```

### Packages management

If you need an additional package in docker, add it to `requirements.in` and run script `./scripts/run-refresh-requirements`.
It will refresh `requirements.txt` file, based on content of `requirements.in`. When finished, you have to rebuild your
docker image to include new packages using `docker build -t human-friction:1.0 .` command. You also have to do it if someone else updated
`requirements.txt` and you pulled it from remote repository.

### Pre-commit

Make sure that code style follows our guidlines by installing pre-commit:
Using pip:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```
Using homebrew:
```bash
brew install pre-commit
```
Then run
